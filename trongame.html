        <h2>Game Rules</h2>
        <p class="rules-paragraph">This game is fairly simple!<br>
            In the movie, the competitors were forced into a life or death game where the Light Cycle bikes would create lines wherever they went. If a bike crashed into a line, the rider would be disqualified.<br>
             And here is the same! Make your opponent crash into your line!
